# Pong Game

Welcome to the Pong Game repository! This project is a classic implementation of the Pong game using the Pygame library in Python. Pong is a two-player sports game that simulates table tennis, where players control paddles and try to hit a ball back and forth.

## Features:

- **Player vs Opponent:** Engage in an exciting match against an AI opponent that dynamically adjusts its position based on the ball's movement.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of scores for both players and witness the countdown before restarting the ball after a score.
- **Responsive Controls:** Control your paddle with ease using the arrow keys for an intuitive gaming experience.

## How to Play:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.
3. Run the `pong.py` file to start the game.
4. Use the up and down arrow keys to control your paddle.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or add new features to enhance the gameplay! Have fun playing Pong!
